# Dot-Files

I was getting annoyed with always keeping my config files in sync on multiple machines,
so here are my configs and a script to install it.

**Note: the installer over writes existing config files**

## Sample Usage

I would recommend if that if you are going to use my script as is (which is probably a bad idea) then you should make it as a checkout in your home directory i.e. `~/dotfiles` then everything will work as expected.

~~~bash
bash install.sh
~~~


## Notes

The font file in `config/font.tff` is the Hack font.
